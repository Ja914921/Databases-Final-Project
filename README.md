## Project Name 
GameSearch

## What is the goal of your project?
I created an app that allows one to create an account and search through databases for games by different features. This app also allows the user to search for games through different filters. It allows for the creation, and deletion of users, and allows one to see other users.

## What interaction does your app provide?
This app can allow for the creation and deletion of user accounts. It also allows users to search for games via filters like top 10 best selling games. This app also allows users to also view some analytics of the game.
